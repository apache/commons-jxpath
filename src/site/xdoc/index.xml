      <section name="The JXPath Component">
          <p>
             The <code>org.apache.commons.jxpath</code> package defines a simple
             interpreter of an expression language called XPath. JXPath applies <em>XPath</em>
             expressions to graphs of objects of all kinds: JavaBeans, Maps, Servlet contexts, DOM etc,
             including mixtures thereof.
          </p>
          <p>
             Consider this example:
          </p>
<blockquote><pre>
Address address = (Address)JXPathContext.newContext(vendor).
         getValue("locations[address/zipCode='90210']/address");
</pre></blockquote>
          <p>
            This XPath expression is equivalent to the following Java code:
          </p>
<blockquote><pre>
Address address = null;
Collection locations = vendor.getLocations();
Iterator it = locations.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()){
    Location location = (Location)it.next();
    String zipCode = location.getAddress().getZipCode();
    if (zipCode.equals("90210")){
      address = location.getAddress();
      break;
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
          <p>
            XPath was standardized by W3C and is used in both XSLT and XPointer.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to find out more about XPath, a good place to start
            is an excellent XPath Tutorial by <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xpath">W3Schools</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The official definition of XPath by W3C can be found at
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Primary applications of JXPath are in scripting: JSP and similar template/script based technologies.
            However, programmers who prefer XML-flavored APIs, should consider JXPath as
            an alternative to other expression languages as well. JXPath is a must-have tool
            for those who work with mixtures of Java objects and XML and need to frequently
            traverse through graphs of those.
          </p>

                primarily intended for those who are interested in extending JXPath.
                It could also be quite useful if you are debugging a tough problem.
